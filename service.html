                                <p> Every property to be protected by a fire protection system needs sufficient water which
                                    should be available at all times to fight the fire. The static storage is provided at the ground
                                    level and terrace level of
                                    the building by means of water storage tanks. The storage is provided generally in such a way
                                    that the municipal water
                                    supply is first received in the fire static storage tank from where it overflows to the domestic
                                    tank. This holds good for
                                    overhead storage too. Thus water will always be available in the event of a fir e. The capacity
                                    of the underground storage
                                    is generally based on at least half an hour's stock of water at the rated draw-off by the fire
                                    pump. This tank also serves
                                    the purpose of a holding capacity into which water from tankers can be poured through an

                                    approved design) which are fully automated to ensure that water is available throughout the
                                    system under the
                                    recommended pressure at all times. Mere opening of a single hydrant landing valve outlet will
                                    make water available to
                                    fight the fire without having to run to the pump house to start the pump. The resultant drop in
                                    pressure in the pipeline
                                    automatically triggers a pressure switch which starts the pump. However, smaller systems may not
                                    be required to be
                                    automatic. The connection to the system is taken from two sub-stations with changeover contacts.

                                <h3>SPRINKLER SYSTEMS:</h3>
                                <p> A Sprinkler is a device connected to a pressurized network of piping and contains a glass
                                    bulb with a special chemical in it. Sprinklers are available at different ratings and operate at
                                    different temperatures.
                                    When a fire takes place, the resultant heat causes the temperature of the chemical in the glass
                                    bulb to rise up and
                                    expand. This causes the glass bulb to break and start a spray of water which covers a certain
                                    area below the sprinklers
                                    so that the fire is fought right when it starts. The sprinkler network is connected to sprinkler
                                    pump, which is connected
                                    to a mechanical alarm that rings as soon as the fire pump starts. Alarm rings the moment a
                                    single sprinkler operates,
                                    thus warning the occupants of an outbreak of fire. The electrical wiring is similar to the main
                                    fire pump. Sprinkler
                                    systems, by virtue of the fact that they are activated automatically as soon as a fire starts,
                                    prevent it's spreading further.
                                    Thus the fire is localized and fought by the system without the help or assistance of occupants
                                    and is fully automatic. As
                                    the provision of the hydrant / sprinkler system is to help the occupants fight the fire till
                                    such a time that the local fire
                                    authority reaches the premises, the fire authorities fight the fire using the system provided
                                    and the equipment brought
                                    by them. The Fire tender consists of mobile water storage and associated pumping machinery
                                    should the premise's
                                    water storage get over. A fire brigade collective breaching is provided on the underground
                                    static storage tank with
                                    instantaneous couplings mounted on them. W ater from the fire tenders can be off loaded to the
                                    under ground storage
                                    tank by means of hose pipes connected from the fire tender. Fire brigade inlet connection is
                                    provided outside the
                                    building and near the riser, through a gate valve and a non - return valve. The pumps of the
                                    fire tender can be connected
                                    to this inlet through which the water in the fire tender can be pumped up in the building to
                                    fight the fire.</p>

                                    etc. Whenever a fire takes place, or smoke is generated, or heat is detected by any one of the
                                    detectors on the network,
                                    the Control Panel gives an audible alarm at the same time identifying the detector which has
                                    sent the signal. The alarm
                                    panel contains a diagram of the property and through an arrangement of classifying zones; it is
                                    possible t o identify the
                                    exact location where the problem has occurred. The alarm panel is a highly sophisticated
                                    intelligent control system
                                    which eliminates the possibilities of a false alarm. The panel also enables checking of the
                                    status of each detector from
                                    the control room itself. The position of each valve (whether open or closed), each section of
                                    detectors and the fact
                                    whether water is flowing through the pipe line the moment the system is activated or not, can be
                                    checked from the
                                    control panel. Hooters with Pill Boxes are provided on every floor in the building. When a fire
                                    occurs on a particular
                                    floor, the occupant breaks the glass of the Pill Box thus causing the Hooter to give a loud
                                    audible alarm. This alarm will
                                    also be reflected on the Main Control panel indicating its position, i. e; the floor at which
                                    the fire has started.</p>
